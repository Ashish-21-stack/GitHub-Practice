this is also after the initial git commit


i used "git add ." to add all the files, then commited using "git commit -m "Complete ch2 and ch3"

since this is being modified after the commit, i have to commit these files, by adding them again, then committing again with a new msg

(this is my fourth commit, as i did some modifications to the text after the 3rd one)
so, use 
"git add filename" to stage the files, then `git commit -m "The msg for commit"`
